# ⚡ - ElectroHydroPotassioHelium
A lightning fast C-style python based compiled language.
## 🔥- Blazingly fast runtime
### ❓ - How it is so fast
Utilising the magic of modern AMD64 compilation technologies ElectroHydroPotassioHelium is able to be many times faster than interpreted languages.
### 🤷‍♀️ - Why it is important
Imagine spending hundreds of hours on making a fantastic application, only for it not being able to be used widely due to performace issues. THAT is why.
### 😜 - The interpreterthose just star
ElectroHydroPotassioHelium features a well-versed interpreter for lightweight use, while not as performant as when compiled interpreted code can be easier for beginner, and does not require a beefy computer to compile. 
## 😊 - Easy to use
ElectroHydroPotassioHelium is intended to be very easy to use for beginners, therefore it uses a lot of the same function and keyword terminology as python and C.
### 😕 - The importance of ease
We're quite sure almost all of us can remember being a beginner developer, overwhelmed by all the new terminology and logic. The ElectroHydroPotassioHelium dev team wants to make sure those who are just starting out can get started quickly, and have a welcoming community to come to. That is why ElectroHydroPotassioHelium is as easy-to-learn as possible.
