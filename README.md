# ⚡ - ElectroHydroPotassioHelium
A lightning fast C-style python based compiled language.

### 😜 - The interpreterthose just star
ElectroHydroPotassioHelium features a well-versed interpreter for lightweight use, while not as performant as when compiled interpreted code can be easier for beginner, and does not require a beefy computer to compile. 
## 😊 - Easy to use
